Searching for jobs in the technological world app
Come to illustrate a basic idea of SPA, written in javascript language
with help of Bootstrap extension and css.

The app uses different dynamic APIs:

1. Shows all categories
2. Show by search
3. Show by category

*It is possible to save a favorite job in a separate "branch" 
(The application uses Localstorage so there is no worry that the information will be lost)
